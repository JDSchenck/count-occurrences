# count-occurrences
[Java] Implementation of an efficient binary search algorithm to count the number of occurrences of particular integers out of an array of 50,000 total integers.

Files:
- TestCount.java : Application/Driver class
- CountOccurrence.java : Binary search algorithm implemented within this class, used to efficiently count the occurrences of query.txt
- array.txt : Data file containing 50,000 integers, used for counting the occurrence of a query integer
- query.txt : Data file containing a list of integers which are searched for, and each occurrence counted
- count_result.txt : Data file generated as output by TestCount.java, will contain the results of the number of occurrences of each query integer from the array of 50,000.
